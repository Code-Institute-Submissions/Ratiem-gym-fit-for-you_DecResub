            <h2>Improved metabolism</h2>
            <hr>
            <p>Increasing muscle mass means you burn more calories. Research shows that muscle 
                burns about 3 times more calories than fat, which means that the more muscle you gain, 
                the more your metabolism speeds up. </p>

            <h2>Increased energy</h2>
            <hr>
            <p>Exercise releases endorphins, which are hormones that make you feel good. We will 
                help develop exercises that also helps increase your endurance. The better your 
                endurance the more energy reserves you’ll have at the end of the day. </p>
