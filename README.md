### Project Goals
The Idea for this project is something I actually can identify with as health and fitness is part of my daily life. From having made a life altering decision in 2018
to get my health back in shape, I spent 2 years working on my weight and health issues which had deteriorated due to fatigue and a lack of control over my work, life balance as well as food choices. My success is complemented to the coaches that helped me achieve my goals. I had initially tried it by myself until l made the decision to get professional help. 

## Target Audience
My website was designed to target people who like me also struggled to balance a structured training program on their own and were in search of help. I wanted this website to be more specific and clear in what it provides. The Facilities page also gives a visual picture of how one can find so many facilities in one gym.
