### Project Goals
The Idea for this project is something I actually can identify with and health and fitness is part of my daily life. From having made a life altering decision in 2018
to get my health back in shape, I spent 2 years working on my weight and health issues whihc had deteriorated due to fatigued and lack of control over my work, life balance as well as food choices. My success is complemented to the coaches that helped me achieve my goals. I had initially tried it by myself until l made the decision to get professional help.
